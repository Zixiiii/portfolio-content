        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Zixi Zhou. I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Michigan. I come from China and graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Joint Institute. My undergraduate major is electrical and computer engineering, and my graduate major is user experience design. I’m now in a 3+1.5 Global Degree Program of SJTU and UM. This year is my last year of the undergraduate and first year of the graduate. My hobbies are Guzheng, calligraphy, and I learn Guzheng and  calligraphy  since I was 10 year old. I’m also good at singing and dancing. I have many experiences in singing and dancing performance. I also love design and photography, but I didn’t learn systematically, so I come to UM to study User Experience Design.

        <h1>Education Background</h1>
        <p>
            I graduated from the Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The Joint Institute is a joint venture between the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The collaboration between the two universities, which began in engineering in 2006, has now expanded to include multiple schools and departments at the University of Michigan, including the schools of Business, science, and Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my undergraduate study, I won the 2020-2021 Excellent Scholarship for Undergraduate students of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and got A or A+ scores in nearly 20 courses, such as Engineering Modified Statistics, linear algebra and differential equations.
        </p>
        <p> I'm now studying at the school of information, the University of Michigan. And my major is User Experience Design.</p>
