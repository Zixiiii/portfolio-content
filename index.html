        <h2>History</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                In the early 1980s, economic reforms resulted in Shenzhen becoming the first special economic zone of China. In thirty years, the city's economy and population boomed and has since emerged as a hub for technology, international trade, and finance. The city's entrepreneurial, innovative, and competitive-based culture has resulted in the city being home to numerous small-time manufacturers or software companies. Shenzhen's rapid success has resulted in the Chinese government turning Shenzhen into a model city for other cities in China to follow.
