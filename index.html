        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Zixi Zhou. I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Michigan. I come from China and graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My undergraduate major is electrical and computer engineering, and my graduate major is user experience design. My hobbies are Guzheng, calligraphy, singing and dancing. I also love design and photography, which I am studying now.

        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute. 
            The Joint Institute is a joint venture between the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The collaboration between the two universities, which began in engineering in 2006, has now expanded to include multiple schools and departments at the University of Michigan, including the schools of Business, science, and Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my undergraduate study, I won the 2020-2021 Excellent Scholarship for Undergraduate students of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and got A or A+ scores in nearly 20 courses, such as Engineering Modified Statistics, linear algebra and differential equations.
